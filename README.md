# UCR CS120B Project: Memory Game
This is my final/custom project for CS120B Embedded Systems. For this project we had to create a project of our choice that combined 
everything that we had learned in the lab and add some complexities. These complexities could be anything from adding a new hardware component that
wasn't covered/used in the lab such as a LED Matrix, RC Car, Robot Arm, N64 Controller, etc. As well as complex software.

## Hardware Complexities/parts that I used
* 32 pin LED Matrix
* 2 ATMEGA 1284 Microcontrollers
* 16 x 2 LCD Matrix 
* 5V Power Supply
* Potentiometer 
* 8 1K ohm resistors
* 2 buttons
* Bunch of breadboard wires and Dupont wires

## Code Libraries/Algorithms I used
* EEPROM, to store the player's best scores for each memory sequence
* Multiplexer algorithm so that I could display numbers/letters on the LED matrix
